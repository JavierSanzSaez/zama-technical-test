## Reflections
### If I had more time, what would I extend or improve?

### AI Coding assistance
I have used Github Copilot AI to help me develop the entirety of this project (except for this README.md). I wanted to take this opportunity to try the famed *vibe coding* and my feelings are somewhat mixed. First, while I was writing this README I got so bombarded with Copilot suggestions that I had to turn it off. 

When creating the project, I used the Copilot agent to set up the initial page and scaffolding and I gave as a prompt a succinted version of the task. One big flaw I felt during this step was that the agent took too much time with the prompt, which I believe it is due to me not providing a clear one (It lagged considerably while trying to implement the Playwright features). This meant that I could not work in parallel because anything I would do in the meantime meant that I would later have to deal with merge conflicts of all kind. Fortunately tho, I spent that time setting up Wakatime and Wakapi, time-tracker plugins that provide very detailed information about the time spent coding and writing docs. Overall, it took the agent around 40 minutes to provide the initial setup.
